GameHub: Pure C Mini-Games Collection
A lightweight, terminal-based game hub built with C. This project is a collection of classic games designed to practice logic, memory management, and terminal UI design.

Status: In Development (Beta)

This project is a personal milestone in my Computer Engineering journey to master the fundamentals of software development.

==Available Games==
Blackjack (21):
-Full game loop against a dealer AI.
-Features Hit/Stay mechanics.
-Automated dealer logic (hits until 17).

Rock-Paper-Scissors:
-Fast-paced gameplay against AI.
-Includes animation sequences using timing functions.


🛠️ Technical Stack & Skills
This project implements several core C programming concepts:

-Windows API: Used <windows.h> for Sleep() and system("cls").
-Logic Flow: Managed game states with nested while and do-while loops.
-Randomization: Used srand(time(0)) for unique game seeds.
-Pointers: Basic pointer usage for display updates.
